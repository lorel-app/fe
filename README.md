## Structure Overview

- **\_android**: Contains the Android-specific build files and configurations required for running the app on Android devices. Managed automatically by Expo for native builds.

- **\_ios**: Holds iOS-specific build files and configurations necessary for running the app on iOS devices. Similar to `_android`, this is managed by Expo during the build process.

- **\_app**: This is the core of the application where most of the app's logic resides.

  - **screens**: Contains individual screen components representing various app views.
  - **navigation**: Includes navigators (stack, header, tab, etc.) and configuration files for handling app navigation.
  - **screens_static**: Stores static screens that require minimal dynamic interaction used by several entry pages.
  - **web_only_navigation**: Contains navigation files and logic specifically for the web version of the app.
  - **index (and other entry pages)**: Acts as entry points for various sections of the app or for platform-specific entry logic.

- **\_assets**: Holds static assets such as images, fonts, icons, and other media files used throughout the app.

- **\_components**: Houses reusable UI components, including buttons, cards, modals, and other building blocks for the app's user interface.

- **\_constants**: Contains files for theming/colors.

- **\_cypress**: Directory for end-to-end (E2E) tests, including test files and configurations for the Cypress testing framework.

- **\_hooks**: Includes custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic. This folder also contains contexts for managing global state and shared functionality.

- **\_utils**: A collection of utility functions and helper modules.
  - **api**: Functions for interacting with Backend.
  - **authContext**: Handles authentication-related logic and context management.
  - **websocket**: Manages real-time communication using WebSocket protocols (interacts with Chat).
